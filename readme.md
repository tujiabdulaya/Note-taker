# Note Taker 

## Description

For this homework i created a Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. The app uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve user generated note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end has already been created. It's my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the finished application to Heroku.
